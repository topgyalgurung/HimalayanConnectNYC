# Himalayan-Connect-NYC

## Objective: 
Himalayan Connect NYC, a comprehensive and user-friendly website that connects the Himalayan community in New York with essential resources.

## Problem statement: 
The Himalayan community in New York faces significant challenges in accessing essential resources such as nonprofit services, legal assistance, immigration support, housing, and job opportunities. 

The information about these services is often scattered across multiple sources, making it difficult for community members, especially those with limited English proficiency or technological experience, to find the help they need. This lack of a centralized, accessible platform creates barriers to important services, hindering the community’s ability to thrive in a new environment.

By offering a streamlined platform with categorized listings, search functionality, and multilingual support, the project will empower individuals and families to easily find the services they need to succeed.

### Run Tests 


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
